After some years and a couple of alpha releases we now have a beta of 5.0.0. Well.. it's marked "beta" but you'll probably find it pretty much stable.

Grab the sources from [the ftp server](ftp://ftp.kvirc.net/pub/kvirc/5.0.0-beta1/source/kvirc-5.0.0-beta1.tar.bz2). Binary packages in various forms are available [here](https://github.com/kvirc/KVIrc/wiki/Downloading-KVIrcs-nightly-source-or-binaries). Please note that the binaries may be marked with the internal version 4.9.3.

Several people have worked on the codebase and ultimately on this release. Many of them hang daily around #kvirc@libera. **[Come](irc://irc.libera.chat/kvirc) and say Hi!**
